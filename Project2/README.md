# Project 2 : Course Search

Link : https://course-search.glitch.me/ 

## Description
Course search is a real time web application that helps users pick the best courses suited for them. It does so by visualizing the courses based on diferent criteria such as workload, difficulty of exams, grading, content and professor reviews. Users can also post their own text reviews/ post queries as well as submit polls to alter the graphical visualizations.



## Design ##
Our color palattes is composed of shades of purple which matches with the theme of NYU Abu
Dhabi. We seek to create a modern minimalistic design that eases the user to navigate and
explore the website

## User Interaction


## Tools and Technologies
1. HTML,CSS and JS for front-end development
1. NodeJS to create our server and glitch to host our server.
2. Chart.js to draw charts and bar graph in our application.
3. socket.io for real time data exchange between server and clients.
4.  Nedb database to store and retrieve our data.

## Key Challenges

## Next Steps



## Features ##
The main feature of the app is the real time poll and real time text review. So, when you select a
course you have taken. You have to go through some verification process that you have actually
taken that course.

Then, you rate the course based on difficulty , workload , exams , grading and
professor. Then if you want to contribute more , you can type a personalized text feedback. For
now, you have to select a course and it redirects you to a new page. The ultimate aim is make a
news feed of all the course reviews with the polls where you can scroll and see review
overviews of different courses.

## Idea and Motivation ##
1. Tired of scrolling through facebook group to find the review for the specific course
2. Needed to way to visualize how a course looks like in general quickly
3. Anynomous feedback so we can truly give our review for the course


We want to expand the feature of this web application into a real-time app thats why we used socket.io than
GET and POST request primariliy.

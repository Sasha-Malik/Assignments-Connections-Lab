## Introduction

A webpage to display multiple web applications created during Connections-Lab. Implemented using Aframe and basic JavaScript.

## User Interaction

Users can move around the three dimensional environment, they can also hover over the 3 poles for the web applications created by me. Clicking on the poles redirects the user to the specific website.

## Key Challenges

1. For some users the page does not work the first time and only works after it is reloaded. I tried to fix this by redirecting the user to the same page primarily but the issue still exists for some users.
2. Positioning the lights (as spotlights) , the objects around the environment (texts hovering on the walls) and cursor interactions.
3. Learning how a-entity and a-scene work and how javaScript can work along with the library.

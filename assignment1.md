## Assignment 1 : Shared Piano
1. The scrolling function does not work while hovering over the keyboard and over some buttons that appear on the music panel, this makes it harder to maneuver to previous sounds. If the scrolling on the specific button/keyboard divs is enabled then it would add a better flow to it.

2. A good change would be to implement a chat box or a communication platform so that multiple users can collaborate while making music. Similarly a prompt to enter the user name before a session would make it easier to distinguish between multiple users.

3. A platform to save the music (without the link creation) would be helpful for users who would like to regularly use the web page to resume their previous work. Building on it, a login feature would facilitate the saving process as well as help in connecting multiple users who would be interested in working together.

4. An invite scheduling portal can help in scheduling multiple events with numerous people and to store as well as view progress during sessions over a period of time. This can be made possible by linking the google calendar accounts when sending invites.

5. The note trail is a really good way of displaying the key pressed function, it helps users in duplicating certain songs. As this would help them know exactly how long the key was pressed by the first person.

6. A host and attendee mode can facilitate music lessons for people who could be interested in taking music lessons online or for a local online band to showcase their compositions live to a larger audience. A popup before beginning would help the user choose.

7. If the Midi device input can be disabled / more key-codes can be added to the javascript then more than one instrument can be played at the same time. 

8. The white colored keys do not seem to work when clicking them at the same height as the black colored keys in the keyboard. This can be fixed by selecting the div elements differently in javascript / placing them differently with HTML.

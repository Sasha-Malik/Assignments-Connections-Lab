## Description

This project allows the users to test their compatibility with a friend based on their respective personalities. The personalities are obtained by answering a short 10 minute questionalire, after which each user can see their personalities (based on the 16 personality distribution) as well as their compatibility with each other.

using js fetch() from Sentino API.
